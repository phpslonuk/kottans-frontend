## Git 

The guide material was very useful, I remembered some points and learned something new

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

It was a very useful material where you can quickly restore old knowledge.
I learned new commands:
lpr, lpq, lprm, groups, finger, |, grep

## Git Collaboration

It was a very short course, where they talked about the rebase and upstream.
I really liked this course!
